# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
	The purpose of this project is to review and analyze the outcomes of Theater campaigns utilizing various descriptive 
	statistics and visualizations of the data.  

## Analysis and Challenges
	Using the tools within Excel, I performed an analysis of campaigns for theater and its subcategory plays. I reveiwed 
	their outcomes based on their goals and launch dates. Using graphs, excel functions and completing calculations of the data, 
	it provides results of theater and play campaigns launched throughout the years. The line graph below is of Theater Outcome vs Launch date. 
	This image provides insight to how many theater campaigns were successful, failed, or canceled based on their launch dates.

	Analysis for plays was also completed using line graph, COUNTIFS functions and percentage calculations. The graph below shows 
	percentage of play campaign outcomes by their goals.

	A challenge that I encountered was creating the Outcomes vs Goals graph showing the data in percentage format. I couldn't find 
	the steps to create the graph with percentages as the y axis.  I searched the web for answers and when I could not find the answer, 
	I turned to my classmates for assistance and clarity on the steps for appropriately creating the graph. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date 

	The data shows that majority of theater campaigns were launched in May and they had a high success rate. Overall, theater 
	campaigns had a high success rate of 60%. Campaigns were launched during the summer months moreso than any other time of the year.     

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

	Analysis for Plays shows that although the majority of campaigns were in the goal range of 1000 to 4999, the campaigns with lesser than 1000
	had a higher success percentage. Plays with high goals have a high chance of failing. The graph below shows percentages of campaigns meeting 
	and not meeting their goals. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

	There were minor difficulties of using the COUNTIFS function, however after completing a few researches and reviewing the hints video in the assignment I was able to use the function. 
	

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

	Outcomes are impacted by when they are launched through the year. 
	The data shows that campaigns launched in warmer months were more successful than in colder months of the year.  
	
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

	Reviewing the data set for Outcomes based on goals shows that the lower the goal is, it has a higher success rate compared to campaigns having higher goals. 
	
- What are some limitations of this dataset?

	Calculating the duration of campaigns and factoring it into the analysis would assist in understanding why campaigns were successful and unsuccesful. The definition of
	canceled campaigns would help in understanding if the campaigns would be included or excluded in the analysis since they could have not been launched and the assignment focused on launched campaigns.
	Canceled campaigns could have been added to the data set and off setting the analysis.  	

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

	Bar graphs could be used. The line graph is providing a visual that there is gradual change when the data actually is 
	a count or volume of outcomes. The dataset is not measuring change over time. The line graphs doesn't provide a clear picture of volume of outcomes.
